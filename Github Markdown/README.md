# Hash makes it <h1> tag
## Double hash makes it <h2> tag
### Triple hash makes it <h3> tag
###### Checking out 6 hash before text

**Bolding Items with double star around it**
__Doube underscore will also bold text__

*Italic item with single star around it*
_Single underscore will also make it bold_

***How does triple star works***

[Linking item to something](http://google.com)

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

* Star at starting makes it a bullet
* Hey I am another buller

- Dashes could also give bullets
- I am new bullet
    - Sub bullet with 4 space and a dash
    - Sub bullet
    3. Always four space makes it another sub point.

* Star will also act as bullet
    * This is also buller with four space and star

This is code by enclosing triple tild
```
print("Hello World")
if(play)
    playing()
```

```javascript
let pets=2;
for(i=0;i<pets;i++)
{
    give_food();
    take_to_walk();
}
```
